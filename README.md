# Introduction to Data Science project on COVID-19 dataset @ TU_Kaiserslautern SS22
The goal of the project is to understand the data science at professional level, to create a dynamic dashboard for visualization, and for final submission of the Enterprise Data Science class at TU Kaiserslautern by developing a COVID-19 prototype.

In the project, standard work flow known as CRISP-DM, which is normally followed at industry-level is followed:

Business understanding
Data understanding
Data preparation
Modeling
Deployment
Data is collected by different methods. However, all the datasets are not used for modeling. Two models are created by using various mathemaical transformations:

To calculate doubling rate for original data and filterd data.
SIR compartmental model.
Also, two dynamic dashboards are created to visualize the models given above.
